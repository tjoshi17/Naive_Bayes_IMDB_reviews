# Naive_Bayes_IMDB_reviews

### Project Overview

The objective of this assignment is to build a Naive Bayes model that classifies the IMDB review is positive review or negative review based on the words in the review.

The key goals are:
- Considering the IMDB review we need to predict the given review is positive or negative.
- Based on train data we need to train the model to get the probability of positive review and negative review.
- Based on this probability we can undderstand that the review positive or negative.
- Check for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, roc curve, auc value for this model to evaluate the model.

In this segment, you will use the IMDB movie reviews dataset to classify reviews as 'positive' or 'negative'. We have divided the data into training and test sets. The training set contains 800 positive and 800 negative movie reviews whereas the test set contains 200 positive and 200  negative movie reviews.

This was one of the first widely-available sentiment analysis datasets compiled by Pang and Lee's. The data was first collected in 2002, however, the text is similar to movies reviews you find on IMDB today. The dataset is in a CSV format. It has two categories: Pos (reviews that express a positive or favourable sentiment) and Neg (reviews that express a negative or unfavourable sentiment). For this exercise, we will assume that all reviews are either positive or negative; there are no neutral reviews.
