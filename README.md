The key goals are:
- Considering the IMDB review we need to predict the given review is positive or negative.
- Based on train data we need to train the model to get the probability of positive review and negative review.
- Based on this probability we can undderstand that the review positive or negative.
- Check for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, roc curve, auc value for this model to evaluate the model.

### Tasks

- Load the data
- Reading and Understanding the data.
- Model Building - Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, ROC curve, AUC value

### Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SKLearn)
- Data cleaning & Analysis
- Naive Bayes
